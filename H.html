        I am sitting with my classmates, writing our theses in the school library. We look at each other and set a time for lunch at 12:40, and now back to writing again. Knowing that my classmates are working on the same work as me gives me a sort of relief feeling. The sense of collectivity makes me more and more immune to a madly spinning world. Human relations that build around my surroundings start to appear, these relations turn to the orientation device. When the entire earth’s surface becomes liquid, a sturdy ark is the only chance of survival. The contributions to this thesis are clear proof. Without other people’s voices, this text would not exist. And all the support by my near and dear ones, family, friends and lovers. When we look around, we see that there is not just one, but an entire colourful host of co-operative things. Within the co-operative body, we take care of all and our surroundings, and our surroundings and all take care of us. They shine their power from diversity, escaping from all forms of bourgeois individualism. Our freedom and autonomy are only possible when we determines together its orientation, and ensures the autonomous direction. Only a gang can wish to reclaim for singularity and defend this space for a long-run artistic career today. In a hybrid, liquid world, our artistic freedom can only exist as a shared freedom. We must stay mobile to be autonomous and becoming liquid autonomy.
